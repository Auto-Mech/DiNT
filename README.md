## Functionality
DiNT is a classical trajectory program for computing adiabatic and nonadiabatic chemistry. The code has a variety of options for preparing initial conditions, for performing final state analyses, and for semiclassical nonadiabatic propagation. The user may supply their own analytic potential energy surface, use one of the previously developed surfaces included in the distribution, or perform direct dynamics calculations. Recent applications include collisional energy transfer and spin-forbidden kinetics calculations.
